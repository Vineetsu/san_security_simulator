## üìñ Overview

The **SAN Security Simulator** is an advanced security management system that demonstrates intelligent, adaptive access control for Storage Area Networks. Unlike traditional static zoning configurations, this system implements dynamic security policies that adapt to real-time threat landscapes, temporal patterns, and emergency scenarios.

### üéØ Key Problem Solved

Traditional SAN security suffers from:
- **Static configurations** that don't adapt to changing threats
- **Manual emergency overrides** that compromise security
- **Limited behavioral monitoring** for threat detection
- **Time-blind policies** that don't consider business cycles

**Our Solution**: An intelligent security system that automatically adapts while maintaining enterprise-grade protection.
